This program is a Text-to-Speech converter built with Streamlit. It allows users to upload a text file, which can be in '.txt', '.doc', '.docx', or '.pdf' format. The program reads the text from the uploaded file and converts it into speech using the Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS) library. The speech is saved as an MP3 file, which the user can download. If there's an error reading the file or converting the text to speech, the program displays an error message.
